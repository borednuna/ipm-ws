  * Provides meta-information about a visual pipeline.
  *
  * This message serves a similar purpose to sensor_msgs/CameraInfo, but instead
  *   of being tied to hardware, it represents information about a specific
  *   computer vision pipeline. This information stays constant (or relatively
  *   constant) over time, and so it is wasteful to send it with each individual
  *   result. By listening to these messages, subscribers will receive
  *   the context in which published vision messages are to be interpreted.
  * Each vision pipeline should publish its VisionInfo messages to its own topic,
  *   in a manner similar to CameraInfo.
